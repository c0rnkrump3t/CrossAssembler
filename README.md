# Cross-Assembler



## Goal
The goal of this project was to create a cross-assembler in Java that processes Cm Assembly Language while using agile processes. This cross-assembler reads assembly language source files, creates an intermediate representation (IR), and generates an executable file. The assembly language consists of low-level binary instructions with labels, mnemonics, and operands. The cross-assembler has help, verbose, and listing options and performs two passes. In the first pass, it generates instructions, a symbol table, and identifies unresolved offsets. In the second pass, it resolves these offsets in the sequence of instructions.
